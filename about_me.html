			I'm currently a 5th year Computer Game Science Major at University of California, Irvine.
			I've taken roles in design, programming and art before.
			My hobbies are reading manga and of course, playing games.  I recently discovered Darkest Dungeon
			and Alien Swarm.  I've been playing World of Tanks and Heroes of the Storm for a while.  I used to play
			too much League of Legends.  My favorite food is Curry.
