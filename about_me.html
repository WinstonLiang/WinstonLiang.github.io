			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
			I'm an undergraduate from the University of California, Irvine, with a degree in
			Computer Game Science.
			I've taken roles in design, programming and art in various game dev projects before.	
			My hobbies are reading manga, playing piano, and of course, playing games.  
			I currently have a soft spot for modernized traditional roguelikes with great pixel art.
