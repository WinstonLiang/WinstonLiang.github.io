			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
			<a href="WinstonLiang_Resume2018_G.pdf">My Resume</a><br><br>
			I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine, with a degree in
			Computer Game Science.
			I've taken roles in design, programming and art before.	
			My hobbies are reading manga and of course, playing games.  
			I've recently been playing a little bit of Path of Exile, and have been pulled back into 
			League of Legends. I've had the opportunity to play Monster Hunter World on PS4 for a month or so
			and eagerly look foward to the PC release. My favorite food is Curry.
