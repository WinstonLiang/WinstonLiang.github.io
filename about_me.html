			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>
			I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine, with a degree in
			Computer Game Science.
			I've taken roles in design, programming and art before.	
			My hobbies are reading manga and of course, playing games.  
			I'm currently considering my next build for the upcoming league in Path of Exile.
			I've had the opportunity to play Monster Hunter World on PS4 for a month or so
			and eagerly look foward to the PC release. My favorite food is Curry. Here's a cool photo of me
			at the Fushimi Inari Taisha in Japan.
