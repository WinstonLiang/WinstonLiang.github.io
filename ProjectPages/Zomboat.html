			<h2>Role: Artist, Designer</h2>
			<p>
			&emsp; This project was for a 3-day game jam (the theme being "waves") and used a particular API for unity that
			allowed anyone with the a given url to interact with the Unity application.  This allowed 
			for a design that was open to the possibility of not only very high accessibility, but
			also no upper limit on the scaling for the number of players.
			</p>
			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>
			&emsp; The idea was spawned from a brainstorming process given to us by a group member from
			Blizzard.  We rapid-fired ideas on post-its until we had about exhausted them, broke for 
			lunch, and then processed the ideas.  We took our favorite ideas and then selected a base
			idea and merged good elements from other ideas.  What emerged was a game where players 
			connected to the game through the API and controlled either a zombie or a human.  Zombies infect, 
			humans hold out until the time limit.  How did we incorporate the theme?  They're all on 
			a boat and waves occasionally wash onboard, pushing both players and objects.<br>
			&emsp;  The game turned out to be loads of fun, in the live demo we were able to get around
			20 people into a game.  You can see a few examples of what it all looked like below.
			I pulled them from the official game jam entry page where you can also download the 
			executable and access the GitHub: <a href = "http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/zomboat">

			<h3>Emergent Gameplay and Evolving Design</h3>
			<p>
			&emsp;  Sometimes you don't know exactly what your design will bring, and that's what
			playtesting is for. In Zomboat, the implementation of the game as well as the 
			visual style led to an emerging style of gameplay which led to an iteration of 
			map design that addressed all of these factors.<br>
			&emsp; In prototyping the game we gave both players and objects
			physics attributes.  This let players, human and zombie alike move objects to shift
			the field in their favor, and also sometimes take an unfortunate turn.  Players could
			form hiding spots for themselves, but also trap themselves.  When we added waves to the
			occasion, that pushed with much larger force over a greater area, they changed the field of
			play greatly every time they occured.  We found that waves could break open stalemates and 
			often change the outcome of a scenario.<br>
			&emsp; For the visual style of the game, we realized that players would all be staring 
			at a single screen while interfacing from their phones.  The environment could not get
			in the way of finding your own player.  The environment, the boat, the objects are all
			a shade of greyscale.  Thus zombies stood out.  However, as a circumstance of the human
			sprite we had pulled, the human sprites did <i>not</i> stand out.  What
			this led to was players hiding statically in groups of objects trying their best
			not to draw attention to themselves.<br>
			&emsp; After we had observed how the gameplay in zomboat had evolved in response to 
			how our game was implemented and designed, we shaped the map design accordingly:<br><br>
			<img src = "Zomboat_2.png" alt = "Zomboat_2" style = "max-width:100%">
			<br><br>
			Note that the spawn points we placed would not start any players inside any of the closed off
			spaces.  The implications of the map mean that as the game progresses, inevitably, waves will 
			break open these rooms giving way for players to play around them.  Players themselves can
			push through them as well, but taking much more time and can't be done while on the run.
			There are a few clusters of barrels next to which players can stand still, trying their
			best to blend in with them.  We designed the waves to spawn more and more frequently by the 
			end of the time limit.  The end result is a map that is slowly changing, unpredictably
			with each playthrough, and as the time limit comes to an end, the map itself creates factors
			that can quickly shift the tide back and forth, and reflects the tension that comes with trying 
			to survive right until the end.
			<br><br>

			Another small detail to take note of is that, once humans are touched by zombies once,
			they bleed indefinitely (unless they find a way to heal some HP) so hiding becomes
			nearly impossible.  Thus, getting away with a scratch is fairly punishing and
			takes away a players ability to hide.  And finally, transforming into a zombie also
			visually stands out, letting both the involved players, but also everyone else on the
			map know that another threat is now on the field.
			</p>
			<h3>Conclusion</h3>
			<p>
			&emsp; The quick-paced nature of the game jam along with an experienced team allowed 
			us to see, concentrated within a very small time frame how design evolves according to
			the choices that were previously made, based on how playstyle emerges to deal with it.
			The game was tons of fun to make, test and play, and to top it off it was a unique
			kind of game that I'm glad to have been a part of.
