				<h2>Role: Designer, Artist, Programmer</h2>
				<h3>Concept</h3>
				<p>
				This project was for a Sound Design for Video Games course at UCI.  As our final project,
				we had to create a game with sound as a central element.  The original concept for the game
				that I had was a system of rooms, each with 4 doors that you could put your ear to 
				and listen to what was behind them, and then pass through them when they opened on interval.
